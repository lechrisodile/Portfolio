As an industrial IT student, I am passionate about intelligent systems, 
          automation, and software engineering. My technical focus spans real-time data integration, 
          IoT connectivity, and the use of modern development frameworks. I aim to build innovative
           solutions that bridge technology and efficiency, 
          allowing me to grow through collaborative and challenging projects.
